# The-Late-Mr.-Kent
A mystery that showcases reflection as well as looking at clues to form new choices. The story's goal is to weave an interesting story along with interactivity, and allow for players to be shown how their choices add impact to the story and creates ripples. It should prove to shwocase reflection on previous actions, whether big or small, and encourage interactivity to understand the narrative better, or to better suit the needs of the player! 

I hope to achieve aproject that entices players enough to explore the options I set out, and to become enthralled in the story as I place them into the shoes of an out of the ordinary character, yet ground them and bring humanity that can allow anyone to understand and feel for the events occuring. I want to provide a sense of immersion that will not take players out of the experience but moreso enhance it.
